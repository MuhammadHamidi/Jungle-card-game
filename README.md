# Jungle-card-game
There are many cards in this game , each card is a symbol of an animal .
At the beginning of the game , 30 cards are randomly given to each player .
In these 30 cards , each animal can be repeated zero to five times .
Then each player , among these 30 cards , puts aside 20 cards and chooses 10 cards and will continue to play with these ten cards .
Then , while everyone can see their opponent's 10 cards , the game starts .
Each player moves one turn and then it is the turn of the next player .
Each player in his turn can choose one or more cards and use them to target one of the opponent's cards .
The player can choose to use any card or cards he has chosen to attack with his normal hit or his strong hit .
Finally , the energy of each of the attacking animals is reduced by the total amount of impact power of each of the attacking animals , divided by the number of attacking animals .
After the attack , the health of the attacked animal will be reduced by the total power of the blows .
If the health of the attacked card becomes zero or less after the attack , that animal is actually killed and removed from the player's card list .
Also , each of the players , three times during the game , is allowed to restore the energy of one of his living cards instead of attacking one of the opponent's cards .
By doing this , the energy of this card will be equal to its initial value .
The game continues in the same way and whenever one of the players succeeds in removing all the opponent's cards from the game , he will win .
Also , this game can be experienced both as a two-player game and as a game with a robot .
